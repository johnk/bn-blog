title: Presenting at FHIR DevDays
---

I'm excited to announce that I'll be presenting BloodNumbers at the [FHIR DevDays conference] (https://www.devdays.com/amsterdam/) next month in Amsterdam. [Firely] (https://fire.ly) and the conference organizers had the excellent idea to add a new ["Patient Innovator" track] (https://www.devdays.com/amsterdam/patient-track/) to the conference, and I was one of the four patient innovators selected to present. I'll be telling my story and demoing the BloodNumbers application at the conference.
