Hello! My name is John, and I am developing an application called BloodNumbers. BloodNumbers is an iOS app for tracking your blood counts. It's designed to be most useful for blood disease patients who want to keep track of all their blood test results in one convenient, portable, and secure place. BloodNumbers is currently under development, and I'm working towards getting it into the iOS app store. This blog provides status updates and other items of interest related to blood count tracking. You can contact me at: john (at) bloodnumbers (dot) com.
